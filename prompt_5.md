# Assignment 5 - Control Structures II

## Game Menu Part II
This assignment will build on top Assignment 4

1. Option to retry opening input file 

- This assumes that in the last assignment you were successful in adding error checking to make sure the file successfully opens. We now want to add the ability for a user to retry entering the file if it does not open successfully. The user should be notified that the file was not valid and given the option to try again or quit. They should be able to do this as many times as they want. If they quit, the user should be prompted with an appropriate message and the program should exit. Formatting and how the user chooses to retry or quit is up to you (by number, letter, path vs an option…) but it should be clear to the user what is expected.

2. Add Main menu and inventory options

- Now that we have a character set up, let’s make the game more interactive. 
After the user chooses their character class, let’s display a menu that has a few options: 

  1. Give the user the option to display the character’s stats. (Your program is already doing this, we just now want to put it behind a menu option)

  2. Give the user the option to choose between their different inventory items and display the chosen item and its stats.

  3. Give the user the option to quit the game. The user should get an appropriate prompt and the program should exit.
The user should be returned to the menu after each choice (except for when they quit).
