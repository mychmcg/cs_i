# Assignment 6 - Functions

## Refactoring to functions
This assignment will build on top of Assignment 5. You will be refactoring your code into several proper functions to make it more readable and maintainable. Remember to use good function names, parameter names, and good practices with function return types.

1. File I/O 
- Refactor your file handling into a function that when called, prompts the user for the name of the file and opens the file. It should then return the file handle (ifstream). It should retain the error handling that you put in place in assignment 4.

2. Character class
- Refactor your code that collects the character class into a function. When called, it should have the same behavior as before. It should then return the name of the character class (string) based on the input of the user (integer). 

3. Game Menu
- Create a function that displays your main menu. The function should take whatever parameters you need to pass the data to display the menu. It should then display the menu as before and return the user's choice.
