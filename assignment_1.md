<a id="org8046842"></a>

## Baking Algorithm


<a id="org5f47c91"></a>

### Problem

**Armed with only a teaspoon**, you set out to bake some brownies. Using the following recipe, design an algorithm (**pseudocode**) that will get the correct ingredients into the mix:


<a id="orgddb0f3a"></a>

### Algorithm

1.  Take out all ingredients

2.  Take out mixing bowl

3.  Arm thyself with teaspoon

4.  If cocoa powder is lumpy, sift it

5.  If powdered sugar is lumpy, sift it

6.  Let TSP_PER_CUP equal the amount of teaspoons in a cup

7.  Add 1.5 \* TSP_PER_CUP teaspoons of granulated sugar to bowl

8.  Add .75 \* TSP_PER_CUP teaspoons of all-purpose flour to bowl

9.  Add .67 \* TSP_PER_CUP teaspoons of cocoa powder to bowl

10. Add .50 \* TSP_PER_CUP teaspoons of powdered sugar to bowl

11. Add .50 \* TSP_PER_CUP teaspoons of dark chocolate chips to bowl

12. Add .50 \* TSP_PER_CUP teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil to bowl

13. Add .75 teaspoon of sea salt to bowl

14. Add .50 teaspoon of vanilla to bowl

15. Crack two large eggs into bowl such that only the yolk and whites are in the bowl

16. Discard the cracked shells

17. Let TSP_PER_TBSP equal the amount of teaspoons in a tablespoon

18. Add 2.0 \* TSP_PER_TBSP teaspoons of water to bowl

19. Follow the rest of the recipe and wash your damn dishes when you&rsquo;re done

## Black Friday Deals


<a id="org5c7e3f7"></a>

### Problem

For black Friday, an electronics store decides to put each item on sale at a discount of 15%. Each item in inventory was originally marked up by 75%. Design an algorithm (**pseudocode**) to find the sale price that a customer would pay. What info is needed to find the sale price?


<a id="orga9f14eb"></a>

### Algorithm

1.  For each item do the following

    1.  Get the markup price

    2.  Let the markup price equal the original price \* 1.7
    
    3.  Let the sale price equal the markup price \* .85
    
    4.  The sale price is the price a customer would pay on Black Friday.
