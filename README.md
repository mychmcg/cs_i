# Comp Sci 1 Homework
This repo contains all assignments from my CS_1 course. Each of assignments 3 through 6 is the same program with an additional set of iterations since the last assignment. The input to the program is in the same format throughout the assignments and therefore I have included the sample input file as well.

Each assignment+prompt has been placed in it's own branch, with the main branch containing the full set.

## Assignment 1
Psuedo-code example assignment

## Assignment 2
Basic utility to calculate the area of a triangle.

## Assignment 3-6  
The program is essentially a textual/cli game menu with more features/refactors added in each subsequent assignment.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo.
2. Compile the desired file.
	- ex: `g++ assignment_6.cpp -o cs_1`
3. Run the executable in your terminal, optionally passing an input file.
	- ex: `./cs_1 testinput`
4. Happy bug hunting!
